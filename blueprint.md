# Project: Lunch Menu Recommendation Blog

## Overview

This project is a content-focused blog that helps users discover lunch menus and restaurants. The primary goal is to provide valuable, high-quality, and engaging content for users who are wondering what to eat. The site is built with clean HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, prioritizing readability and user experience to meet Google AdSense quality guidelines.

## Core Principles (AdSense Alignment)

*   **High-Quality Content:** The site will be regularly updated with original articles, reviews, and recommendations. Content will be user-focused, providing real value and answering the user's core question: "What should I eat for lunch?".
*   **User Experience (UX):** The design is clean, simple, and easy to navigate. The site is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The layout prioritizes content readability.
*   **Trustworthiness (E-A-T):** The site includes essential pages like "About", "Privacy Policy", and "Terms of Service" to build user trust and demonstrate professionalism.

## Site Structure

*   **`index.html`**: The main homepage, designed as a blog feed displaying the latest articles.
*   **`about.html`**: A page describing the mission and purpose of the website.
*   **`privacy.html`**: A standard privacy policy page.
*   **`terms.html`**: A standard terms of service page.
*   **`style.css`**: A clean, modern stylesheet focused on readability and responsiveness.
*   **`main.js`**: Reserved for future interactive features. Currently minimal.

## Monetization Strategy

*   The primary monetization method will be Google AdSense. Ads will be placed thoughtfully to avoid disrupting the user experience, in full compliance with AdSense placement policies.
*   `ads.txt` is implemented correctly to declare authorized ad sellers.

## Future Plans

*   Add a "Contact" page with a form for user suggestions and partnership inquiries.
*   Develop a category system to filter posts by region (e.g., Gangnam, Pangyo) or food type (e.g., Korean, Japanese, Italian).
*   Implement a search functionality.
